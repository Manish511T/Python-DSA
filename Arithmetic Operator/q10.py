# Initially, you have a bank account balance of 100 dollars.

# You are given an integer purchaseAmount representing the amount you will spend on a purchase in dollars, in other words, its price.

# When making the purchase, first the purchaseAmount is rounded to the nearest multiple of 10. Let us call this value roundedAmount. Then, roundedAmount dollars are removed from your bank account.

# Return an integer denoting your final bank account balance after this purchase.

# Notes:

# 0 is considered to be a multiple of 10 in this problem.
# When rounding, 5 is rounded upward (5 is rounded to 10, 15 is rounded to 20, 25 to 30, and so on).
 
#  Input: purchaseAmount = 9

# Output: 90

# Explanation:

# The nearest multiple of 10 to 9 is 10. So your account balance becomes 100 - 10 = 90.

purchaseAmount = 15

roundedAmount = ((purchaseAmount + 5) // 10) * 10
